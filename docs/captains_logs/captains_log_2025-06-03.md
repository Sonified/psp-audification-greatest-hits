## Project Initialization: PSP Greatest Hits

- **Objective:** Transform the existing "Wave Doctor" HTML page into "PSP Greatest Hits" to showcase three specific audified Parker Solar Probe data files: E13 CME, E16 Rising Tones, and Venus Flyby 4.
- **Key Changes Planned:**
    - Update `index.html` with a new title, and three sections corresponding to the audio files, including descriptions from `file_notes.txt`.
    - Modify `js/main.js` to handle single audio file loading per section and remove unused UI elements/logic (raw/processed toggle, multi-example buttons).
    - Audio files to be used:
        - `PSP_Audification_2022_09_05_CME_Video_Sync_v1.4_PRE_POST_WAVES.mp3`
        - `E16_Risers_Stereo_2023_06_21_2321_to_2336_PSP_Mag_Bt_L_Bn_R.mp3`
        - `Venus_Flyby4_2021_02_20_1955_to_2040_Mag_Bn_Cleaned_Shortened.mp3`
- **Initial Setup:**
    - Confirmed file list and descriptions to be used.
    - Outlined changes for `index.html` and `js/main.js`.

## Audio Path and Toggle Re-correction - 2025-06-03

- **Issue:** User indicated previous path correction to `streaming_mp3s/` was incorrect; the target directory is `audio/`. Audio was still stuck on "Loading audio..." and a `TypeError` related to `waveDoctorToggle` was present if the HTML toggle was missing.
- **Cause & Resolution Strategy:** 
    - The user prefers the original HTML structure including the toggle and the `audio.js` structure that uses `loadAudioPair`.
    - `index.html` was previously updated to include the `wave-doctor-toggle` elements again, resolving the `TypeError` if `js/main.js` attempts to access it.
    - `js/main.js` in the `loadAndSetupAudio` function was modified:
        - Both `newRawPath` and `newProcessedPath` are now set to `\`audio/${currentAudioBasename}.mp3\`;`.
        - This ensures the script uses the `audio/` directory and satisfies `audioManager.loadAudioPair()` by providing two (identical) valid file paths.
        - The `waveDoctorToggle.disabled = false;` line was confirmed to correctly enable the toggle now that it exists in the HTML.
        - Logic for `audioManager.startPlayback(waveDoctorToggle.checked, ...)` and the toggle's event listener for `audioManager.setWaveDoctorEnabled()` are preserved as per user preference for the original structure.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Verify audio files are correctly placed in the `audio/` directory at the project root.
    - Perform thorough testing: audio loading, playback, waveform display, and toggle functionality (which should not produce audible changes but should not error).

## Audio System Restoration - 2025-06-03

- **Issue:** `TypeError: audioManager.loadAudioPair is not a function` was occurring.
- **Cause:** `js/audio.js` had been previously modified to a single-audio-source system (with `loadSingleAudio`), while `js/main.js` was set to use `loadAudioPair` and the dual-source system.
- **Resolution:**
    - `js/audio.js` (WaveDoctorAudioManager class) was significantly refactored to restore the dual audio buffer system:
        - **Properties Restored:** `rawGain`, `processedGain`, `rawSource`, `processedSource`, `rawBuffer`, `processedBuffer`, `isWaveDoctorEnabled`.
        - **`constructor` and `setupAudioNodes()`:** Updated to initialize and configure these dual-system properties (e.g., connecting `rawGain` and `processedGain` to `masterGain`).
        - **`loadAudioPair(rawUrl, processedUrl)`:** Method re-implemented to fetch and decode two audio files into `this.rawBuffer` and `this.processedBuffer`.
        - **`loadSingleAudio()` was removed** (as it's not used by the current `js/main.js`).
        - **`startPlayback()`:** Modified to accept `waveDoctorEnabled` and manage `rawSource` and `processedSource`.
        - **`stopPlayback()`:** Updated to handle both sources.
        - **`setWaveDoctorEnabled(enabled)` and `updateCrossfade(useProcessed, fadeTime)`:** Methods re-implemented to manage the toggle state and audio crossfading.
        - **`getDuration()`, `getCurrentTime()`, `seekTo()`:** Adjusted to work with the dual-buffer system (typically referencing `rawBuffer` or whichever is available).
    - Corrected a typo in `setupAudioNodes`: `this.processedGain.connect(this.masterGaine)` changed to `this.masterGain`.
    - Escaped backticks in `console.error` calls within `loadAudioPair` in `js/audio.js` to fix syntax errors.
- **Current State:** Both `js/main.js` and `js/audio.js` should now be aligned on using the dual audio path system with `loadAudioPair`.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Thoroughly test the page: audio loading from `audio/` directory, playback for all three tracks, play/pause functionality, waveform visualization, and ensure the toggle switch (though not audibly different) does not cause errors.
    - Address any remaining functional issues before optimizing for streaming.

## Refactor: Remove Toggle and Rebrand "Wave Doctor" - 2025-06-03

- **Objective:** Remove the "Raw/Processed" toggle functionality and rename "Wave Doctor" related identifiers to be more generic or specific to "PSP Greatest Hits".

- **`index.html` Modifications:**
    - Removed the `div` with class `toggle-container` (which included the toggle switch and "Raw"/"Processed" labels) from all three audio sections.
    - Renamed class `wave-doctor-example` to `audio-example-section` on all three `<section>` elements.

- **`js/main.js` Modifications:**
    - Removed all code related to `waveDoctorToggle` (variable declaration, usage in the `player` object, event listeners, and any logic depending on its state).
    - Updated `document.querySelectorAll('.wave-doctor-example')` to `document.querySelectorAll('.audio-example-section')`.
    - Changed the audio manager instantiation to `const pspAudioManager = new PSPAudioManager();`.
    - Modified `loadAndSetupAudio` to use `pspAudioManager.loadSingleAudio(audioPath)` (pointing to the single MP3 file in the `audio/` directory).
    - Simplified `pspAudioManager.startPlayback()` calls, removing the toggle state parameter.
    - Removed the `isWaveDoctorEnabled`-related parameter from the `drawWaveform()` call within `startWaveformAnimation`.

- **`js/visualizer.js` Modifications (drawWaveform function):**
    - Updated the initial file comment to "PSP Greatest Hits Visualizer".
    - Removed the `isWaveDoctorEnabled` parameter from the function signature.
    - Internal logic now uses default values: `ctx.strokeStyle` defaults to `colorTheme.mid`, and `verticalScale` defaults to `1.0`.

- **`js/audio.js` Modifications (Major Refactor):**
    - Renamed class `WaveDoctorAudioManager` to `PSPAudioManager`.
    - Updated the initial file comment to "PSP Greatest Hits Audio Manager".
    - Implemented a single audio source model:
        - Removed properties: `rawGain`, `processedGain`, `rawSource`, `processedSource`, `rawBuffer`, `processedBuffer`, `isWaveDoctorEnabled`.
        - Added/Retained properties: `audioSource` and `audioBuffer` for the single audio stream.
        - `setupAudioNodes()`: Simplified to no longer configure dual gain nodes; `audioSource` connects directly to `masterGain`.
        - Replaced `loadAudioPair(rawUrl, processedUrl)` method with `async loadSingleAudio(audioUrl)`.
        - `startPlayback(startOffset = -1)`: Signature and logic simplified for a single audio source.
        - `stopPlayback(resetPosition = true)`: Simplified for a single audio source.
        - Removed methods: `setWaveDoctorEnabled(enabled)` and `updateCrossfade(useProcessed, fadeTime)`.
        - `getDuration()`, `getCurrentTime()`, `seekTo()`: Ensured these methods operate correctly with the single `this.audioBuffer`.

- **`styles.css` Modifications:**
    - Replaced all occurrences of the CSS class `.wave-doctor-example` with `.audio-example-section`.
    - Removed CSS rules that specifically targeted `.wave-doctor-toggle` and its pseudo-states (e.g., `:checked`, `:disabled`) as the toggle element is no longer in the HTML.
    - Note: Color theme rules like `.audio-example-section[data-color="blue"]` now apply background color to the whole section, as the part of the selector for the toggle slider was removed.

- **Next Steps:**
    - Thoroughly test the page for correct audio loading and playback, waveform visualization, and absence of errors related to the removed toggle or old class names.
    - Review visual styling, especially background colors of sections, if the default behavior from the CSS changes is not desired.
    - Once basic functionality is confirmed, discuss optimization for fast loading and streaming.

## Fix: Isolate Audio Playback per Section - 2025-06-03

- **Issue:** All audio sections were playing the same audio file (the last one loaded), instead of their respective unique audio files.
- **Cause:** A single `PSPAudioManager` instance was shared across all sections. Its internal `audioBuffer` was being overwritten by each successive call to `loadSingleAudio` during page initialization. Thus, only the last loaded audio file was available for playback for all sections.
- **Resolution (`js/main.js` Refactor):**
    - **Independent Audio Managers:** A new `PSPAudioManager` instance is now created for each audio section within the `exampleSections.forEach` loop.
    - **`player.audioManager`:** This section-specific audio manager instance is stored directly within each `player` object (as `player.audioManager`).
    - **Scoped Audio Operations:** All audio operations (e.g., `loadSingleAudio`, `startPlayback`, `stopPlayback`, `seekTo`, `getDuration`, `getCurrentTime`, `getWaveformData`) are now called on `player.audioManager`, ensuring they affect only that section's audio.
    - **`allPlayers` Array:** An `allPlayers` array was introduced to store references to all created `player` objects, facilitating access (e.g., in the window resize handler).
    - **`currentlyPlayingSection` Management:** 
        - This variable now stores the `player` object of the currently (or last) active section.
        - Logic was updated in the play button event listener and `loadAndSetupAudio` to correctly stop the `audioManager` of a *different* `currentlyPlayingSection` before starting or reloading audio for the target `player`.
    - **`startWaveformAnimation(player)`:** The function signature was simplified to only take the `player` object. It now internally accesses `player.audioManager` for waveform data and timing.
    - **Window Resize Handler:** Updated to iterate over the `allPlayers` array to correctly find and update the static waveform for each loaded, non-playing section upon resize.

- **Next Steps:**
    - Test thoroughly to confirm that each audio section now plays its correct, unique audio file.
    - Verify all playback controls (play, pause, seek), waveform display, and inter-section playback logic (stopping one when another starts) are working as expected.
    - Check for any new console errors.

## Feature: Add Audio Fade Transitions - 2025-06-03

- **Objective:** Implement smooth fade-in and fade-out effects for audio playback start and stop/pause operations.
- **Changes in `js/audio.js` (PSPAudioManager class):**
    - **`AUDIO_FADE_DURATION` Constant:** Added a global constant `AUDIO_FADE_DURATION = 0.05;` (50 milliseconds) to define the fade time.
    - **`setupAudioNodes()`:** 
        - `this.masterGain.gain` is now initialized to `0` using `setValueAtTime(0, this.audioContext.currentTime)`. This ensures audio starts silent before any fade-in.
    - **`startPlayback(startOffset = -1)`:**
        - Calls `this.stopPlayback(false, true)` at the beginning. The `true` (for `forRestart` parameter) signals `stopPlayback` to handle gain appropriately for an immediate restart (e.g., ensure gain is at 0 for a clean fade-in) without treating it as a user-initiated pause.
        - After `this.audioSource.start()`, the `masterGain.gain` first cancels any scheduled values, then sets its current value (which should be 0 if starting fresh or after a stop), and then performs a `linearRampToValueAtTime(1, now + AUDIO_FADE_DURATION)` to achieve a fade-in effect.
    - **`stopPlayback(resetPosition = true, forRestart = false)`:**
        - Added a new boolean parameter `forRestart`.
        - If `this.isPlaying` is true or `forRestart` is true:
            - If it's a genuine user stop/pause (i.e., `!forRestart` and `isPlaying`), `this.pauseTime` is updated.
            - If `this.audioSource` exists:
                - `masterGain.gain` cancels scheduled values, sets its current value, and then performs a `linearRampToValueAtTime(0, now + AUDIO_FADE_DURATION)` for fade-out.
                - The actual `this.audioSource.stop()` and `disconnect()` calls are delayed using `setTimeout` (for `AUDIO_FADE_DURATION * 1000 + 50` milliseconds) to allow the fade-out to complete. The `this.audioSource` property itself is nulled immediately.
            - If `forRestart` is true and no `audioSource` exists (e.g., if called on an unplayed manager instance), it ensures gain is explicitly set to 0.
        - `this.isPlaying` is set to `false` immediately as the fade-out begins, reflecting that playback is ceasing from a user perspective.

- **Next Steps:**
    - Test audio playback start/stop/pause extensively to ensure smooth fade transitions are working as expected.
    - Verify that rapid start/stop actions or playing one track after another still behave correctly with the new fade logic.
    - Check for any audio glitches, unexpected volume changes, or console errors.

## UI Update: Section Title Formatting - 2025-06-03

- **Objective:** Update the formatting of section titles in `index.html` to be more descriptive labels.
- **Changes in `index.html`:**
    - The `<h2>` title for the first audio section was changed from "E13 Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)" to "Encounter 13: Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)".
    - The `<h2>` title for the second audio section was changed from "E16 Rising Tones" to "Encounter 16: Rising Tones".
    - The `<h2>` title for the third audio section ("Venus Flyby 4") remained unchanged as it already serves as a suitable label.

- **Next Steps:**
    - Review the updated titles on the webpage.
    - Continue with any further testing or feature requests.

*   **UI Theme**: Implemented a minimal "space-chic" dark theme (`styles.css`, `js/visualizer.js` for canvas background).

### June 3, 2025 - End of Day (Actually June 4 early AM)

Today's progress:
* Removed a sentence ("This sonification is timed with WISPR visuals.") from the description of the first audio example in `index.html` as per user request.
* Verified and removed a duplicate `drawStaticWaveform` function definition from `js/main.js`. The correct and sole definition now resides in `js/visualizer.js`.
* Changed the section title for the third audio example from "Venus Flyby 4" to "PSP Encounters Venus" in `index.html`.
* Updated the footer in `index.html`: changed the text of the first paragraph and made "Listen To SPACE!" a hyperlink to the NASA Video YouTube page.
* Removed the copyright line ("&copy; 2025 PSP Audification Project") from the footer in `index.html`.
* Applied a linear gradient (bottom-left to top-right) to the background of audio panels in `styles.css` to make them visually less flat. The gradient transitions from the theme's `section-bg` color to its `mid` color.
* Implemented an animated starfield background:
    * Added `<canvas id="starfield-canvas">` to `index.html`.
    * Styled the canvas in `styles.css` to be a fixed, full-screen background.
    * Created `js/starfield.js` with logic for generating, drawing, and animating rotating stars.
    * Included `js/starfield.js` in `index.html`.
* Updated the first audio section in `index.html`: removed "(CME)" from the main title and added it to the description paragraph.
* Modified `js/starfield.js` to change the animation from a circular rotation to a horizontal scrolling parallax effect, simulating sideways movement through space. Stars now have a depth (`z`) property affecting their speed, size, and opacity.
* Adjusted the `baseScrollSpeed` in `js/starfield.js` from `0.5` to `0.2` to make the parallax effect slower.
* Refactored `js/starfield.js` to improve behavior on window resize: stars now scale proportionally with canvas size instead of being randomly regenerated, and wrapped stars maintain their z-depth characteristics.
* Updated header styling in `styles.css`: increased `<h1>` font size to `3em`, and made the `.tagline` brighter (`#e0e0e0`) and italicized.
* Reduced `margin-bottom` of `<h1>` in `styles.css` from `5px` to `2px` to move the tagline closer to the main title.
* Modified waveform click behavior in `js/main.js`: if audio is not playing, clicking the waveform now starts playback from the beginning instead of the clicked position. Seeking by clicking is still enabled if audio is already playing.
* Updated play/pause button: increased size via CSS padding/font-size, and changed content from text to symbols (▶ for play, ⏸ for pause) in `js/main.js` and `styles.css`.
* Set initial state of play buttons in `index.html` to display '▶' symbol and removed default `disabled` attribute, ensuring correct initial appearance before JS loads audio.
* Increased the width of the `.play-button` in `styles.css` by approximately 60% by adjusting horizontal padding from `15px` to `24px` per side.
* Modified play/pause symbols to allow independent sizing: wrapped symbols in `<span>` elements (`play-symbol`, `pause-symbol`) in `js/main.js` and `index.html`. Added CSS in `styles.css` to make the pause symbol (⏸) approximately 30% larger than the play symbol (▶).
* To prevent the play/pause button from changing dimensions when the symbol changed, set a fixed `height: 50px;` and `width: 85px;` for the `.play-button` in `styles.css`. Flexbox properties (`display: inline-flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;`) are used to ensure the symbol remains centered within these fixed dimensions.
* Added a linear gradient to the play/pause buttons in `styles.css`, transitioning from the theme's "dark" color at the bottom-left to its "mid" color at the top-right (corrected from a previous top-to-bottom gradient).
* Reduced `margin-bottom` of `<h1>` in `styles.css` from `5px` to `2px` to move the tagline closer to the main title.
* Changed the main page title in `index.html` (both `<h1>` and `<title>` tag) to "Parker Solar Probe's Greatest Hits".
* Reduced `font-size` of `<h1>` in `styles.css` from `3em` to `2.8em`.
* Further reduced `font-size` of `<h1>` in `styles.css` from `2.8em` to `2.6em`.
* Corrected approach for visual effect: Made the direct background of the waveform drawing area (the canvas) semi-transparent, allowing stars to show through *behind the waveform lines*. The main audio section panels remain opaque. This involved:
    * Reverting audio section panel backgrounds to be fully opaque.
    * Setting `.waveform-container` background to `transparent` in `styles.css`.
    * Setting `.waveform-canvas` CSS background to `rgba(16, 16, 16, 0.5)`.
    * Changing `CANVAS_DRAW_BG_COLOR` in `js/visualizer.js` to `rgba(16, 16, 16, 0.5)`.
* Enhanced starfield parallax effect in `js/starfield.js` by increasing `maxZ` from `5` to `10` and `numStars` from `350` to `400`, creating a more pronounced sense of depth.
* Made the `.time-display` text color lighter (from `#b0b0b0` to `#cccccc`) in `styles.css`.
